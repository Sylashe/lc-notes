## Problem

> Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.    Example 1:   Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2 Output: [1,2,3,5]   Example 2:   Input: head = [1], n = 1 Output: []   Example 3:   Input: head = [1,2], n = 1 Output: [1]     Constraints:   	The number of nodes in the list is sz. 	1 <= sz <= 30 	0 <= Node.val <= 100 	1 <= n <= sz     Follow up: Coul...

## Code

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        dummy.next = head

        fast = dummy
        slow = dummy
        while n != 0:
            fast = fast.next
            n -= 1
        while fast.next != None:
            fast = fast.next
            slow = slow.next
        slow.next = slow.next.next
        return dummy.next
```
