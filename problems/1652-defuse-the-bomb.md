**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems//
**Difficulty:** Easy
**Tags:** `Array` `Sliding Window`

## Problem

> You have a bomb to defuse, and your time is running out! Your informer will provide you with a circular array code of length of n and a key k.  To decrypt the code, you must replace every number. All the numbers are replaced simultaneously.   	If k > 0, replace the ith number with the sum of the next k numbers. 	If k < 0, replace the ith number with the sum of the previous -k numbers. 	If k == 0,...

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def decrypt(self, code: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        n = len(code)
        ans =[0] * n
        if k > 0:
            r = k + 1
            s = sum(code[1:k+1])
            for i in range(n):
                ans[i] = s
                s += code[r % n]
                s -= code[(r - k) % n]
                r += 1
        if k < 0:
            k = abs(k)
            r = n
            s = sum(code[r-k:r])
            for i in range(n):
                ans[i] = s
                s += code[r % n]
                s -= code[(r - k) % n]
                r += 1
        return ans
